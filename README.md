# Reaction Simulation Data ETL

## Overview

This ETL pipeline ingests time-series simulation data generated by its sister project, found at https://github.com/joshvernaz/reactionetl-generator. Reaction simulation data and metadata are found, validated to match the destination schema, pre-processed and written to another directory, loaded into PostgreSQL, and then transferred to cold storage.

---

## Key Features

- Automated table creation for smooth deployment

- Schema validation for incoming CSV data and JSON metadata into target PostgreSQL tables

- Incremental loading, only ingesting new data

- Automated file structure management

- Cold storage for processed data

## Database

The PostgreSQL database has two tables: 

- `dim_rxn` - stores metadata about the reaction, such as initial reactant concentrations and temperature, `simulation_id`, and the reason the generator stopped the simulation.

- `fact_sim` - stores time series data tied to the `simulation_id`.
